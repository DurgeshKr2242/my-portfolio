            content="Portfolio website of Durgesh Kumar. Hi I'm Durgesh Kumar and I  am currently pursuing my Btech in Computer Science from KIIT.  My interests are in Web development and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences along with creating and optimizing user-friendly websites for customers with a range of business objectives. The tech Stack that i am familiar with is MERN Stack. Apart from HTML and CSS, I have a good knowledge of the latest JavaScript which is ES6+ along with JavaScript frameworks like React and meta meta-framework like NextJs. I am also familiar with UI libraries like MUI which was previously known as Material Ui and Tailwind CSS.  I am also familiar with backend technologies like NodeJS Express and MongoDB.  as well as experience using Firebase SDK like Firebase firestore firebase auth and firebase storage. And I have also used SAWO labs API for authentication in my web apps.                                                                     I previously interned at a Foundation which is known as TARF where I led the Backend team to develop the server-side architecture of the website. I built the project with other engineers over the period of 2 months on a MERN stack. I also was a member of the Frontend team in the project wing of Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador KIIT. There we developed a web app that would do REST API call and provide a summary or transcript of any YouTube video. I am also part of many top societies in my college like KIIT E-CELL and Google Developers Student Club. In KIIT ECell we recently did a KIIT Startup Conclave which is one of the flagship events in kiit and there we invited many guests and one of them being the UI/UX lead of CRED. CRED is a startup you must have heard about. And in Kiit startup conclave I aided in making the entire website. It was basically a SPA. And I recently became a Postman Student Expert meaning I am proficient in the essential skills involved in building and testing API requests in Postman.
            Being a member of one of the best societies in my college, such as E-CELL, GDSC-KIIT, and MLSA-Project Wing, working with the best that our campus has to offer, and leading my team in multiple community projects, I believe I have acquired excellent team player and leadership skills, which will give me an advantage over the competition.
            My greatest strength is my ability to not only write but also read code produced by others, as well as my ability to work under high pressure. As a member of the E-Cell KIIT technical team, I along with my team was in charge of designing the web page of KSK -2021 (KIIT Startup Conclave), one of KIIT's signature events. And the event's website page required a lot of last-minute adjustments owing to a speaker canceling due to an emergency and having new speakers for the event, as well as changes in the web page's about us section, and none of the other technical team members with the essential competence were accessible. As a result, I talked with the necessary team members, and even though Because the codebase was unfamiliar to me, I made the necessary adjustments at the last minute.
